## Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================
This game is to practice writing object-orientated javascript on app.js while resources.js and engine.js (modified) were provided by Udacity.

#### Getting Started.
===============================
Clone or download the file in to your desktop. Open the index.html file.
Use the arrow keys to move the character. Evade the enemy bugs and cross the character to the water
to go to the next level and the game increases the enemy. Enjoy!

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
